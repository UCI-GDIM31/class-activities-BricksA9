1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?\
they're floats because they represent the numerical value of a specific color. Combined, they make up a color on the color spectrum. Ints wouldn't be precise enough, 
while bools can basically store only black and white (false/true).
Strings can store characters, which would probably work better in a hexadecimal system where only one variable is controlling the final color.\
4. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?\
It's an int because you can't have 0.2 of a bounce; it must always be finished in order to count as a bounce.\
3. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?\
It was missing a semicolon.\
