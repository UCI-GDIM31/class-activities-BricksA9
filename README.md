Added cat movement and changed the view to first person :D

1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?\
they're floats because they represent the numerical value of a specific color. Combined, they make up a color on the color spectrum. Ints wouldn't be precise enough, 
while bools can basically store only black and white (false/true).
Strings can store characters, which would probably work better in a hexadecimal system where only one variable is controlling the final color.
2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?\
It's an int because you can't have 0.2 of a bounce; it must always be finished in order to count as a bounce.
3. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?\
It was missing a semicolon.

Method Discussion Activity
1. The method will take an integer called sanity (or whatever the sanity level variable is called), 
and then change the brightness variable (again, whatever it’s actually called).

Monobehavior Coding Activity
1. A skinwalker (the component), depending on the type of skin they're wearing (classes), will behave differently. 
The skin will tell the skinwalker how to behave. The traits of the skin (color, texture, etc) will change the behavior type. 
The methods change the behavior, while the variables change the appearance of the skin.
2. There's no upper limit to how many times the ball can increase in brightness.
